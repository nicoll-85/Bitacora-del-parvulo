						p.text__description Advancement in technology has made communication easier than ever before. Withinstant message, chat, web conferencing, Slack, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Skype, email,phone, etc., we’ve never had so many ways to connect and stay connected.One might assume that all these options makes us more connected – that working t		ogether as a team is easier because of it. However, in his book, Stop Talking, Start Communicating, Geoffrey Tumlin suggests that our “hyper-communicative” world is making us worse at connecting on a personal level, not better. We’re losing our ability to engage in what he calls “high-consequence” conversations, because we opt for methods that are easy rather than effective.
						p.text__description We text bad news instead of delivering it in person. We yell at each other in all CAPS via email when we would never think of talking like that if we were in person. We copy the entire company on messages intended for just one person. And we assume that, just by writing something, communication has occurred.
						p.text__description Your ability to build relationships at work hinges on your ability to communicate effectively. That means being willing to have hard conversations and use the right medium for those conversations. It means learning how to connect face-to-face and demonstrate real empathy for someone else’s point of view while sharing your own in a way that is respectful,clear, and collaborative.
